## A collective of individuals
Best engineers want freedom and flexibility. This is why it's becoming harder and harder to get them on board with permanent contracts. We've created a collective of impressive contributors met along the way, and we provide them with exciting projects to work on, so they stay around for the long run while keeping their freedom.‚Äç 

When an individual isn't enough,¬†*The Citadel*¬†brings the organization of a team, so you keep the best of both worlds for your projects. We've built a productive remote culture enabling the ability to work instantly with anyone, from all over the world.
