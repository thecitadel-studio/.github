## A collective of individuals

Best engineers want freedom and flexibility. This is why it's becoming harder and harder to get them on board with permanent contracts. We've created a collective of impressive contributors met along the way, and we provide them with exciting projects to work on, so they stay around for the long run while keeping their freedom.‍ 

When an individual isn't enough, *Citadel* brings the organization of a team, so you keep the best of both worlds for your projects. We've built a productive remote culture enabling the ability to work instantly with anyone, from all over the world.

## Principles

A collective look very close to an agency. There are a few major differences, a collective is:

- **Horizontal**: There is no hierarchical level in a collective, but more different responsibilities (as described below);
- **Freedom friendly**: Each member can choose the missions, and the coworker of the collective to work with, with no obligations;
- **Transparent**: No hidden facts inside a collective, people work as equals and are aware of everything;
- **Flexible**: People can work in or out of the collective, it’s a bonus for members not a burden;

At Citadel we respect to simple rule before considering a business relationship with a client:

1. We sell only “from scratch” development services and maintenance of our own projects. This is to maintain very high-quality standards;
2. We only start a project if:
    - We have received and reviewed the final designs (UI and technical architecture);
    - We have the right team available;
    - The paperwork is complete;
